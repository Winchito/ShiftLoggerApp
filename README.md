# ShiftLoggerApp



It's a FullStack-Project with a REST API as Backend and a Console APP as Front, The Project consists on a Shift Logger for Workers, you can Create, Read, Update and Delete Workers, Shifts and link those on a Shift Logger table to know which worker took a specified shift, that ShiftLogger has also CRUD operations.


I used MVC and Entity Framework for Backend and ConsoleTables for Frontend
